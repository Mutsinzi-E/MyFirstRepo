 My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year.
My Goals for the Coming Year
As I transition from high school to university, I have set clear goals to guide me through this important stage of my life. One of my main goals is to prepare well for university by strengthening my academic skills, especially in subjects that are related to the course I plan to study. I want to stay focused, continue reading, and keep learning even while waiting to join university.

I also plan to improve my English and communication skills by reading more books, writing regularly, and practicing speaking clearly and confidently. In addition, I want to start learning useful skills like computer literacy and research skills that will help me succeed at the university level.

Another important goal is to stay disciplined and manage my time wisely. I want to create a productive daily routine and avoid wasting time on distractions. Finally, I aim to take care of my physical and mental well-being by staying active, thinking positively, and surrounding myself with supportive people.

This coming year is a time of preparation and growth for me, and I am determined to use it wisely as I get ready for university life.
