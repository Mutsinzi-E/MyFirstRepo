# Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Enock Mutsinzi from Rwanda. I am learning GitHub to manage my projects and work with other developers. This is my first experience using version control.

I enjoy learning about technology and look forward to building my skills in software development. This repository is part of my learning journey.
